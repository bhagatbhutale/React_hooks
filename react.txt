1. What is Hooks ?
--> Hooks are special function that allows us to use state and other React features in functional components.

So this was the problem with funcitonal components 

But after introducing React Hooks from version 16.8, we can now use state management and other react features without writting class components.

in other words, Hooks are the funcitons that make functional components work like class components.

Benifits -->

React hooks simplicity the code, improve the readablity, reusablity and overall performance of the applications.

useState , useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback, useContext, useReducer, userLayout


1. UseState -->
useState in a react hook, which creates an "state variable".
Which helps us to track state in components & update the user interface and state changes.


2. UseEffect -->
the useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effect in your components.
example 
- fetching data from api
- Direct Updating dom 
- used setTimeout and setInterval

3. useRef --> 
that allows us to create mutable variables which will not re-render the components
- useRef is also use for accesing DOM elements
